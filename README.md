This respository contains the documents for creating a data product in R using the Shiny package. 

The data product we have created is a graph that plots random variables. 

To have the data plot be hosted on a website, we needed both a code for the user interface(ui.R) and a code for the server(server.r).

The documentation for this project is available in the master branch and in the gh-pages branch of this repository. 

Enjoy!
